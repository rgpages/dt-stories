		<p>COTTAGE GROVE — It’s the sharp pop of the glove hitting the opponent’s training mitt that initially gets people hooked on boxing, Cottage Grove High School Principal Iton Udosenata said.</p>
		<p>But a mix of feelings keeps them coming back, he said.</p>
		<p>“Adrenaline plays a role," he said. “But it’s more than that. It’s a sport that teaches you about yourself, about how to better respect others and how to work through things with patience."</p>

	<div class="spec-story">
		<p>The 36-year-old principal has recently broken new ground as a Lane County educator by starting a boxing club for students who may not necessarily fit into the mold of a typical high school athlete. Those students, as well as other area educators and parents, are loving it.</p>
		<p>The satisfying popping sound described by the coach rang out in the basement of the Cottage Grove Armory on a dark, rainy Tuesday in mid-February.</p>
		<p>The South Lane Boxing Club has made the space its own, at least for two days of the week.</p>
		<p>During that Tuesday practice, 16-year-old Alex Clifton was working on landing a punch squarely with Udosenata, who is his boxing coach and school principal.</p>
		<p>“I fell in love with (boxing) the first time I did it," Clifton said. “I think I’ll be doing this as long as my body allows me to."</p>
		<p>Udosenata has been principal at Cottage Grove High for four years, and since October he has been connecting with his students in a different way: by teaching them the centuries-­old art of boxing.</P>
		<P>Twice a week, he meets with about a dozen middle school and high school students, coaching them in their new sport and giving them a safe way to channel emotions and punch out their frustrations. He also teaches them about patience, poise and respect for the opponent.</p>
		<p>“A lot of people think boxing is just about hitting each other, but it’s more of a chess game, he said. “The person who makes the smarter moves, wins."</p>
		<p>For this, Udosenata charges $25 a month to cover expenses. </p>
		<p>“If they don’t have the money, I just say, ‘Hey, throw me $10 when you can,’ " Udosenata said.</p>

		<h4>Invested in club</h4>
		<p>Udosenata — known to the students as “Udo" — has used his own money to fund the effort. It will cost him about $2,500 a year to run the gym: about $120 a month to rent the basement, $300 a year to keep his USA Boxing credentials current and about $720 a year for recurring equipment needs.</p>
		<p>Starting up the operation wasn’t cheap, either. Udosenata said he spent about $2,500 on equipment, including large punching bags, speed bags, mitts, gloves, head protection, cups — and a $1,800 boxing ring with padding. </p>
		<p>The boxing club is not associated with the school district, but it is certified through USA Boxing, which also certifies Udosenata as a coach.</p>
		<p>Udosenata said that separation from the school district makes the sport accessible to students who otherwise might not be able to participate.</p>
		<p>“For school sports, kids have to have a certain grade point average and good attendance, and there’s a lot of expectations from the coach," he said. “It’s very much structured. All of those things are good, and I believe in them, but there are a lot of these great kids who don’t fall into those categories — who can’t meet those grades and pay the fees and make it to practice every day."</p>

	<div class="spec-story">
		<p>Cottage Grove School District Superintendent Krista Parent said the district supports Udosenata and the club because they are offering an unconventional activity.</p>
		<p>“This seems to be attracting a different group of kids altogether as well as students who are already athletes within the district," she said.</p>
		<p>Parent said that although the club is not sanctioned through the district, it’s an important part of the community. </p>
		<p>“We think it’s awesome," she said. “We’ve encouraged him to commit his time to it; we fully support it and would love to see him grow it."</p>
		<h4>From boxer to coach</h4>
		<p>Udosenata’s own love of boxing started with a chance glance at a newspaper ad.</p>
		<p>Udosenata, 36, was born and grew up in Eugene.</p>
		<p>When he was 21, he spotted a boxing gym ad in a newspaper.</p>
		<p>“I called the number, and someone answered, and I quickly hung up," he said. “And then someone called me back and said, ‘Are you scared or something?’ " </p>
		<p>He wasn’t. Udosenata became hooked on the sport after his first workout at West Eugene Boxing in 2002.</p>
		<p>“One of my fondest memories was the first time I stepped into the ring," he said. “It’s much different than backyard boxing with your buddies. I had butterflies that I had never experienced in any sporting event — it’s hard not to when you know that you’re getting into the ring with an opponent who is far more skilled than you. My opponent worked me, but I was hooked," he said. “It was probably the adrenaline."</p>

	<div class="spec-story">
		<p>Seven years later, Udosenata began coaching an amateur boxer who was preparing for a fight. He continued coaching until he accepted the job of assistant principal at Willamette High School in 2011.</p>
		<p>Udosenata said boxing changed his life. </p>
		<p>“This sport helps you learn about yourself, your character and camaraderie," Udosenata said. “It teaches you a different kind of respect of your opponent. When I walked out of that ring the first time, I carried myself differently and had more confidence — just a lot of values I want to give to these kids."</p>
		<h4>Club started in garage</h4>
		<p>As they worked through mitt drills, Clifton and Udosenata were joined by the small group practicing basics of boxing and fogging up the basement’s windows with their exertion.</p>
		<p>The basement boxing venue in the heart of downtown Cottage Grove hasn’t always been  the South Lane Boxing Club’s designated practice space. For several months, Udosenata’s boxing students arrived at 6 a.m. to practice in his garage in Cottage Grove.</p>
		<p>“I found out that some kids were backyard boxing, and I told them I would teach them, but that we had to do it the right way," Udosenata said.</p>
		<p>So he renewed his coaching license around Christmas last year and began hosting and leading the early morning boxing session three to four times a week. But more kids heard about the fledgling boxing group and wanted to join.</p>
		<p>“I’d say 95 percent of the students in the program right now just came up to me and asked to join out of curiosity," Udosenata said. “More kids want to join, too."</p>
		<p>They don’t seem to mind the hard work.</p>

		<h3>Work and camaraderie</h3>
		<p>Beads of sweat streamed down Leonel Sotelo’s face as his gloved fists beat a steady rhythm on a speed bag.</p>
		<p>Nearby, two sisters sparred in the red, white and blue boxing ring in the center of the room.</p>
		<p>Others jumped rope or worked on their footing, stance and balance.</p>
		<p>Sotelo, a 16-year-old Cottage Grove High School junior, said that although boxing is a padded, stylized, rule-driven kind of fist fight, he feels a sense of camaraderie with his opponent.</p>
		<p>“It’s an adrenaline rush when you’re fighting," he said. “But when the fight is over, you and your teammate almost become closer. It’s the best feeling in the world."</p>
		<p>From 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the students meet with Udosenata and another volunteer coach, Brian James, 40. They work together on their skills. Some of them are planning to compete in a boxing match at West Eugene Boxing on March 11. But most of the students aren’t training for a specific event.</p>
		<p>Sophia James stood next to a full-size punching bag, her waist-length, red hair tucked into French braids. Sweat from her workout had glued a few loose tendrils to her flushed cheeks. She explained why boxing sometimes is the perfect remedy.</p>
		<p>“When you have a really bad day, it’s good to punch it out," the 16-year-old said. “It relives stress and puts this confidence in you. Just knowing that, if you needed to, you could protect yourself helps you stand up a little straighter."</p>
		<p>That’s something that volunteer coach Brian James appreciates as well. Sophia and her sister, 14-year-old Sabrina, are his daughters.</p>
		<p>“I really wanted something like this purely for my daughters’ safety," he said. “I like the idea that they might be able to throw a combo and distract someone enough to just get away."</p>

		<h4>A fulfilling endeavor</h4>
		<p>The boxing is building the sisters’ friendship as well. The James sisters often work on their boxing techniques together, in and out of the ring.</p>
		<p>“It was kind of awkward at first, because I didn’t want to hurt her," Sophia James said. “But now we have an understanding that we just want to be better and help each other; we’re honest with one another. Like when I’m sucking at something, she tells me, and same with her."</p>
		<p>As they spar, the two often call advice out to each other; how to adjust their footing, when to duck for an upcoming swing and when to block a punch.</p>
		<p>“This is probably my favorite of all the sports I’ve ever done," James said. “I was the first girl to sign up."</p>
		<p>Udosenata said the money and time spent is worth it, especially if it can have a positive effect on even just one life. </p>
		<p>“Other (boxing) places in Eugene are really expensive," Sotelo said. “And here I feel like I have a place to work through things that stress me out with a coach I trust. This helps a lot."</p>
		<p>“It adds up, but we make do," Udosenata said. “To be honest, it gives me a reason to leave the building at 4:30 p.m. and still get to work with kids."</p>
