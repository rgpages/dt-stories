    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>They suffered through a rare losing season, winning only two conference games. Their in-state rivals beat them, and the head coach was fired after only four years on the job.</p>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>The Oregon Ducks of 2016? Sure. But that would also describe the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football_team'>Alabama Crimson Tide of 2006</a>. That’s right: Even the mighty Tide — they of the four national titles since then — have down years.</p>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>On the heels of <a href='http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/football/35030529-69/oregon-state-beavers-end-eight-years-of-civil-war-football-frustration-against-oregon-ducks.html.csp'>Oregon’s first losing season in 12 years</a>, it’s easy for Duck fans to forget that the most storied programs in college football stumble now and then.</p>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>In fact, of the top 10 teams on <a href='http://collegefootball.ap.org/top-100'>The Associated Press’s list of the 100 greatest college football programs</a>, only one school has not had a losing season in the past 20 years.</p>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Lumping Oregon in with those 10 programs (the Ducks actually land 28th on AP’s list, so they’re not at dynasty-level yet), it should have been no surprise that Oregon coach Mark Helfrich, who finished with a 4-8 record this season, was let go. Every head coach but one from the top 10 who had a losing season was gone within three years, and usually quicker. The one program that didn’t fire a losing coach was Oregon.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Coach Mike Bellotti’s 2004 Ducks were 5-6, and he was kicked upstairs to make way for Chip Kelly four years later. (The long-term fates of two other coaches with losing seasons — Nebraska’s Mike Riley and Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly — are yet to be determined.)</p>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Texas has had the typical response to down years. John Mackovic was canned after the Longhorns won only four games in 1997, Mack Brown resigned three years after he went 5-7, and Charlie Strong was just fired following three losing seasons.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Michigan, too. Rich Rodriguez was let go after the Wolverines went 15-22 from 2008-2010, and Brady Hoke (Oregon’s former defensive coordinator) was dismissed after his 5-7 record in 2014.

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Speaking of Notre Dame, the legendary Fighting Irish have endured five losing seasons in the past 18 years. That number climbs to seven if we count the two recent seasons in which they’ll likely vacate their victories due to NCAA violations. (For simplicity and consistency sake, the records shown in these charts reflect the results on the field of play.)</p>

    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Here are Nebraska’s win-loss totals: three losing seasons since 2004.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Here’s the Alabama chart. Tide fans stuck through four failed campaigns in 10 years before their unprecedented run of late. Of the 11 teams scrutinized here, only Notre Dame has fewer victories during this 20-year span.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>The team with the most wins? Oklahoma has averaged nearly 10 a year, despite two off years in 1997-1998.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Three of the AP top 10 teams have had one losing season since 1997. One is Pac-12 rival Southern Cal, which was 5-7 in 2000 before hiring coach Pete Carroll. The Trojans were 31-29 over the five seasons preceding their run of seven consecutive seasons of 10 wins or more.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>Another is Ohio State, 6-7 in 2011. The Buckeyes now have a chance for five consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories.</p>

    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>The third is Florida. Coach Will Muschamp stepped down following 4-8 and 7-5 seasons. The Gators are 18-7 since then. Florida won national titles in 2006 and 2008.</p>

    <img src='http://uploads.registerguard.com/newsroom/web.sp.dynasties.1128/web.sp.florida.1128.jpg' width='100%'>
    <br>
    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>The only team without a losing season? Florida State fans haven’t had to stomach a losing record since 1976, though they came close with three 7-6 teams in the last 11 years. In fact, the Seminoles are the only team in AP’s all-time top 25 that hasn’t had at least one losing season in the last two decades.</p>

    <p class='BodyText-BodyText'>It seems that the most distinguished dynasties have their slumps. Only time will tell if Oregon pulls out of this one.</p>
