				<p>Eaton didn’t set a world record this weekend, but he did send a message. The Olympic champ, competing at less than 100 percent physically, is still considerably better than everybody else. He won his fourth U.S. title on Sunday, scoring 8,750 points to qualify for his second Summer Games.

				<p>Felix moved from fifth to first in the final 100 meters to finish in 49.68 seconds, the fastest time in the world since she ran 49.26 to win the World Championships last year. It was the third-fastest time of her career under adversity that had her coach proclaiming it Felix’s best moment. Former Oregon star Phyllis Francis was second with a personal best of 49.94, and Natasha Hastings grabbed the final Olympic spot in 50.17.

Venerable Bernard Lagat, 2015 World Outdoor Championships qualifier Hassan Mead, former Duck Eric Jenkins and 2016 NCAA runner-up Futsum Zienasellassie all did not finish the race.

				<p>Heading to Rio in the women’s high jump are a three-time Olympian and mother of three, a teenage world champion and daughter of an NFL quarterback, and an athlete returning from a doping suspension, festooned with more than 30 tattoos and wearing a two-piece red outfit topped off by a blue Mohawk haircut. They are, respectively, 32-year-old Chaunté Lowe, 18-year-old Vashti Cunningham and 29-year-old Inika McPherson.

				<p>On Reese’s fourth attempt Saturday, she thrilled 21,866 fans at Hayward Field when her soaring leap measured 23 feet, 11¾ inches for the win and more important, wind-legal at 1.7 meters per second on a day in which many jumps exceeded the allowable 2.0. In the process, Reese set or equaled several records and all-time accomplishments in the women’s long jump.

				<p>The women’s 800-meter final was marred by a collision coming out of the final curve and form chart favorite Alysia Montano fell to the track. She eventually finished the race, nearly a minute after her fellow competitors, to cheers from the crowd. Kate Grace won the 800-meter final in 1:59.10 in one of the more shocking victories of these Olympics Trials. The 25-year-old Yale graduate was injured last season.
