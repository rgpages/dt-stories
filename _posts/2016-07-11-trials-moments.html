				<p>Devon Allen embraced the moment, holding up an “O" as he stood behind his starting blocks when introduced before the final of the 110-meter hurdles on July 9. Then he went out and ran a 13.03 to put himself on the team bound for Rio. He powered away from the field over the closing hurdles and won decisively. Ronnie Ash and Jeff Porter claimed the two other Olympic spots, both in 13.21 and separated by a thousandth of a second.

Lagat closed with a 52.82-second final lap to steal the victory and secure his spot on Team USA in what was a spectacular four-man finish.

				<p>The women’s 800-meter final was marred by a collision coming out of the final curve and form chart favorite Alysia Montano fell to the track. She eventually finished the race, nearly a minute after her fellow competitors, to cheers from the crowd. Kate Grace won the race in 1:59.10 in one of the more shocking victories of these Olympics Trials. The 25-year-old Yale graduate was injured last season.

				<p>Brenda Martinez edged Amanda Eccleston by .03 seconds with a dive at the line to place third in the women’s 1,500 meters. The dramatic finish resounded even more with Martinez after she was a favorite in the 800 on Monday before getting caught up in a collision with 120 meters to go that ended her Olympic dream in that event. There wasn’t much drama at the front of the race. Jenny Simpson pulled ahead on the third lap and won in 4:04.74, and Shannon Rowbury pulled away from the rest of the field during the final 100 to finish second in 4:05.39.

				<p>New Jersey high schooler Sydney McLaughlin, 16, was third in 54.15 ­setting a world junior, American junior and national high school record on the last day of the event. Ashley Spencer was a surprising second in 54.02. Spencer is the first woman ever to make finals at the U.S. trials in both the flat 400 and 400 hurdles. She barely made it out of the first round as the 16th qualifier and ran the final out of lane eight. Dalilah Muhammad won the women’s 400-meter hurdles in 52.88, by far the fastest time in the world this year. Previous fastest was 53.51 by Texas A&M’s Shamier Little, who did not make the finals.
