			<p class="spec-dropcap2-miller">The Ducks did not win a team title this year but the NCAA championships were still exciting. Many records were broken, including one from 1936 and another from 1966, and Oregon’s two-sport star returned to the national stage.</p>
		
			<p>Here are some highlights from the 2016 NCAA Outdoor Track & Field championships. For more, check out our <a href="http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/trackandfield/" target="_blank">Track & Field section</a>.</p>

				<p>Cheserek tied the NCAA record for most titles by winning the 10,000 Wednesday and the 5,000 on Friday. The Oregon junior is the first to win those two events back-to-back since Suleiman Nyambui recorded three-straight distance sweeps between 1980-82.</p>
