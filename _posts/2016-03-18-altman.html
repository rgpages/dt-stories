<p class="spec-dropcap2-miller">SPOKANE — Mitch Richmond knew where he wanted to play ball, and it sure as heck wasn’t in Missouri.</p>
<p>The hotshot guard from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., had already signed with a different school, Westark Community College in Arkansas. At the urging of his high school coaches, Richmond decided to take one more trip to meet the coach who’d been recruiting him over the phone.</p>
<p>Richmond, flying in an airplane for one of the first times in his life, landed in Columbia, Mo., and immediately felt confused. The tall, sandy-haired man from Moberly Community College looked nothing like he expected.</p>

<p>“Where’s the coach?" Richmond asked.</p>
<p>“I’m the coach," Dana Altman said.</p>
<p>“I just bust out laughing, like, ‘C’mon man, you’re too young to be the coach,’" Richmond recalled. “I said, ‘This is who I’ve been talking to all this time?’"</p>
<p>If you want to know where the story starts, that’s it: Moberly, Mo., in 1984. Richmond was a future all-American and NBA all-star. Altman, the coach who recruited him, was on his way to bigger things.</p>
<p class="spec-dropcap2-miller">More than 30 years later, Altman has Oregon in an unprecedented place. The Ducks are a No. 1 seed for the first time in their history, preparing to face Holy Cross on Friday in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>This is all new for Oregon, and it’s new for Altman as well. He spent most of his career at Creighton, coaching Davids instead of Goliaths. In 27 years as a head coach, he’s been to the Sweet 16 exactly once.</p>
<p>Altman and Oregon have reached this point both by evolving and by staying the same. In some ways, he’s still the same 26-year-old coach who recruited Richmond at Moberly. In other ways, he’s adapted his philosophy to fit a team that might be the most talented he’s ever coached.</p>
<p>“Our offense has changed quite bit from team to team and year to year," said Kevin McKenna, an assistant who coached with Altman at Creighton and now with the Ducks. “We’ve added and taken things out. We ran more stuff for Joe (Young) last year, and we’re running different types of things for different guys this year.</p>
<p>“We’ve evolved, but we’ve adapted to the guys we have."</p>
<p>This quality — the ability to adapt to the personnel at his disposal — is one characteristic that makes Altman one of college basketball’s elite offensive coaches.</p>

	<div class="spec-story">
<p>Another characteristic, cited frequently by opposing coaches and Altman’s own players, is his ability to create a mismatch. That quality has been evident with this year’s Ducks, who score by spreading the floor and trying to dictate favorable matchups.</p>
<p>“He recruits guys that are very versatile," said sophomore Dillon Brooks, a 6-foot-7 forward who leads the Ducks in scoring at 16.8 points per game. “Me, Dwayne (Benjamin), Elgin (Cook), we can play a lot of positions.</p>
<p>“He’s good at finding mismatches and making plays so that player can score. If that player is hot, he has a play up his sleeve to get him a shot or get him a great look to make a play for another teammate."</p>
<p>Often the Ducks initiate this in the simplest of ways, with a basic three-man weave on the perimeter. It’s a way of probing the defense, of seeing whether defenders will switch or create a specific matchup.</p>
<p>“If one of our guys thinks they have a seam, they’ve got the freedom to take it," Altman said. “We let them play out of it. There’s not a lot of rules."</p>
<p class="spec-dropcap2-miller">Altman’s philosophy has parallels in the NBA game, Richmond said, which puts more emphasis on individual matchups. Much of his success flows from an ability to scout an opponent, identify weaknesses and exploit the mismatches that work in his favor.</p>
<p>“How he plays is pretty much like a pro style," said Richmond, who scouted in the NBA before joining Chris Mullin’s staff at St. John’s. “Just like in the NBA, you try to get the matchup that you really, truly want, and that guy becomes the creator. I think he’s a master at that."</p>
<p>Altman’s base offense, the high post, was adapted from Johnny Orr at Iowa State. It’s designed for a team like Oregon’s, which lacks a true low-post threat but has versatile big men who can drive, pass and shoot.</p>

<p>Altman has adjusted over the years, but the fundamentals are the same ones he used in the Missouri Valley Conference.</p>
<p>“We run a lot of the same things," Altman said. “We had a lot of shooters there, so we could really spread the floor.</p>
<p>“The things I’ve done out of that high post, that’s been over 20 years that we’ve done a lot of the same base stuff. Some of our go-to plays are still things that we ran at Creighton."</p>
<p>At Creighton, Altman’s formula was to recruit two or three great athletes and surround them with shooters. This Oregon team is athletic at almost every position, with Cook, Brooks, Benjamin and Tyler Dorsey playing on the wing and Jordan Bell and Chris Boucher in the post.</p>
<p>Altman has stopped short of calling this the best team he’s ever coached, though Oregon’s accomplishments thus far make a strong case. In a reflective moment after the Pac-12 title game, he acknowledged that opportunities like this one are rare.</p>
<p>“I’ve been fortunate to have a few of them, but not a lot," he said. “In 27 years, you’d hope for a few more."</p>
<p>Altman took a circuitous route to get here, from Moberly to Marshall to Kansas State, then to Creighton and Oregon. With his team primed at last for a deep run, this is Altman’s chance to make a classic NCAA Tournament cliche come true.</p>
<p>If March is all about matchups, you have to like Oregon’s odds.</p>
